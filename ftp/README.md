# ftp
file transfer protocol practise
It is a very simple ftp server and client program, I do this for my
teacher's homework -- to show something that means I have learned for
the semester. We learned about network programming, so just a simple 
ftp server or web server could be a good chance for I have never programmed
any before.It is really basic works, you may not show much interestes 
on them, just enjoy youself. I will apriceate that any questions or problems.
